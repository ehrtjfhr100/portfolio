<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Hi I'm Unu</p>
<p>I love to make <strong><u>images</u>, stories, whole art</strong> but some how I felt like there was something missing. And that was connection with the outside world.</p>
<p>My background is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_art" target="_blank" title="contemporary art"> contemporary art</a>. The goal of contemporary art is destruction of original form and recreation of newness. Being an avant-garde is fun, but there is risk of enjoying it alone. So, I decided to learn <strong>coding</strong> to be more influencial person through web.</p>
